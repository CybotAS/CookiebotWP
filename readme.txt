## Description ##

**Cookiebot by Usercentrics** is a **Google-certified CMP (consent management platform)** that automates cookie compliance. It detects cookies and trackers, pauses non-essential ones until a choice is made, records consent for audit, and passes consent to Google via **Consent Mode v2**—helping you meet **GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, LGPD, ePrivacy** and more.

**Why it matters:** basic banners that don’t control scripts can leave tracking running without permission—raising compliance risk and reducing measurement accuracy because valid consent isn’t signaled. **Cookiebot by Usercentrics** handles consent correctly, keeps cookie information up to date automatically, and preserves analytics and ads—with less manual effort.

**Trusted at scale:** **2.3M+ site scans/month**, **7B+ consents**, **600,000+ websites**, **60 languages**.  
Set up in minutes. No code required.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Is Cookiebot free? ###

Yes. You can start on a **Free plan** to try the core consent features and upgrade anytime as your needs grow.

### My banner isn’t showing on my site, what do I do? ###

First, confirm that your **Domain Group ID** is correct in the plugin settings. If it still doesn’t appear, open the **Support** tab, copy the **debug info**, and **contact support** so we can check your setup.

### How do I customize my banner? ###

Open the Cookiebot Admin. You can adjust layout, colors, texts, and buttons to match your brand and choose how choices are displayed.

### How can I check my cookie scan results or repeat them? ###

Go to the Cookiebot Admin to view scan results. You can also trigger a new scan there whenever you update tags, plugins, or embeds.

### Why am I being offered a trial? ###

The trial lets you experience the product before deciding. If you’re not ready to upgrade after the trial, you can continue on the Free plan.

### Can I switch to a different legal framework? ###

Yes. The Cookiebot by Usercentrics plugin for WordPress supports multiple legal frameworks by allowing you to set up separate banner configurations for different regions or countries.

To do this, enable “Multiple Configurations” under the Multiple Configurations tab in the Cookiebot plugin settings, then add banner configurations for the specific regions you want to support.

This setup uses separate Domain Groups for each configuration and the data-georegions attribute in the Cookiebot script to display the correct banner based on the visitor’s location — for example, one for GDPR and another for CCPA/CPRA. You can run multiple configurations, as long as only your primary Domain Group contains your actual domain.

### What is Google Consent Mode and how can I use it with Cookiebot? ###

Consent Mode lets Google tags adapt to each visitor’s choice. Cookiebot sends that consent status automatically, so conversions from consenting users are tracked as usual, and non-consenting visits are handled in a privacy-safe way to reduce data gaps in your reports. Result: clearer conversion visibility and steadier campaign optimization, without custom code — just enable Consent Mode in the Cookiebot Admin.

### Does Cookiebot integrate with the WP Consent API? ###

Usercentrics Cookiebot is fully integrated with the WP Consent API. When your visitors give consent using Usercentrics Cookiebot, the consent will automatically be sent to the [WP Consent API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-consent-api/).
