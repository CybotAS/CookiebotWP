## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### Is Cookiebot™ free? ###
Cookiebot CMP WordPress Plugin is a freemium plugin, much like Jetpack and Monsterinsights. Cookiebot™ also has a Free Plan option.

Whether the free plan is sufficient or you need a premium plan depends on two things:

1. The size of your website, i.e. the number of subpages on your website, which determines whether you are eligible for the Free Plan. For websites up to 50 subpages, you have the choice between the Free Plan and Premium Lite. [Get a quote](https://www.cookiebot.com/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=banner) to see which plan your site needs.

2. The features you need. The free plan **does not include** all features available in the premium plans. The free plan does not include customization of banner and cookies declaration, multiple languages, email reports, data export, geolocation, bulk consent, consent statistics, internal domain alias for development, test and staging. However, our Premium Lite package is available for only €7/month for all domains with fewer than 50 subpages, including all premium features mentioned above.

When you sign up for Cookiebot CMP, you will automatically be enrolled in our free 14-day trial for one domain. During the trial, you will have access to all premium features of the Cookiebot CMP.

See all details of Cookiebot CMP [plans and pricing](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/pricing/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=banner).

### My WordPress website has less than 50 subpages, why should I upgrade to Premium Lite? ###
The Premium Lite package comes with great features that enhance your cookie consent solution. Upgrading to Premium Lite after your 14-day free trial enables you to build user trust and provide an advanced, personalized user experience. Apply  custom branding and geotargeting to your banner, among other features. It also gives you more control over your WordPress website’s privacy compliance with the automated monthly and daily scan reports.

### What does Cookiebot™ count as pages? ###
Your pricing plan is dependent on the number of subpages the Cookiebot CMP detects on your website.

Cookiebot™ does not count image files as subpages, which could set users to a higher subscription plan. Depending on your theme, WordPress may automatically create real pages for content placed in your media library, called Attachment pages. Because these pages can contain online trackers, Cookiebot CMP includes them in your page count.

To disable the Attachment page feature in WordPress, please see the following guides:

https://themeskills.com/disable-media-attachment-pages-wordpress/
https://www.wpexplorer.com/disable-image-page/

### Cookie declaration ###
Cookiebot CMP includes an automatically updated cookie declaration for the cookies in use on your site.

By implementing it, you can ensure that your cookie declaration is detailed and accurate at all times, as required by the GDPR. Also, the declaration automatically provides the mandatory options for the user to be able to change or withdraw consent.

For CCPA and CPRA compliance, businesses will be able to display the required “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link on their cookie declaration.

To display your cookie declaration, create a new page on your website and add the shortcode to the page that’s provided by the plugin: [cookie_declaration]. Alternatively, you can incorporate it into your existing Privacy Policy.

By default, the cookie declaration is displayed in the selected Cookiebot CMP language. You are able to override this setting with a “lang” attribute in the shortcode, e.g.: [cookie_declaration lang=”de”] for a German version. Remember to add all languages used in the [Cookiebot CMP Admin Interface](https://admin.cookiebot.com/login).

### Cookie-checker: What cookies are in use on my site? ###
If you are in doubt about what cookies are in use on our site, start with our free compliance test:

**[Test my site](https://www.cookiebot.com/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=banner)**

The test scans up to five pages of your website and sends you a complete report of the cookies and online trackers in use on these pages, including information on their provenance, purpose, and whether or not their use is compliant with EU regulations.

If you want a complete overview of the cookies and online tracking on your website, sign up for the Cookiebot CMP solution.

### How can I set up my cookie banner with Cookiebot CMP? ###

Here is **[our step by step guide](https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408356523282-Getting-started)** on how to set up your cookie banner.

### How does Cookiebot CMP block cookies and trackers?###
Cookiebot CMP provides two modes to block cookies and trackers before consent has been given.

1. **Cookie auto-blocking mode** will automatically block all cookies (except for ‘strictly necessary’ cookies) until a user has given consent. [Learn more about the cookie auto-blocking mode](https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009074960-Automatic-cookie-blocking).
2. **Cookie manual-blocking mode** requests manual adjustments to the cookie-setting scripts. [Read more about the cookie manual-blocking mode](https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405978132242-Manual-cookie-blocking).

### What is the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive? ####
The GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation, an EU data privacy law enforced since May 2018. It protects EU citizens’ personal data globally and affects all organizations and websites that handle such data. If you have a website with users from the EU, and if your website uses cookies (it probably does), then you need to make your use of cookies and tracking compliant with the GDPR and obtain user consent.

See the [EU GDPR homepage](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679) for more information, or their infographic for businesses: [Data Protection: Better rules for small businesses](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/smedataprotect/index_en.htm).

The ePrivacy Directive is another EU legal instrument that specifically aims to protect EU citizens’ online data, including that from electronic communications. It is in the process of becoming a full regulation like the GDPR.

### What is the CCPA and CPRA? ###
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a state-wide law that regulates how businesses all over the world are permitted to handle the personal information of California residents. Starting from January 1, 2023 the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) comes into effect, amending and extending the CCPA.

You are required to comply with the CCPA if your business:

- sells the personal information of more than 50,000 California residents per year (increased to 100,000 under the CPRA as of January 1st, 2023)
- as annual gross revenue exceeding USD 25 million
- derives more than 50 percent of annual revenue from the selling of personal information of California residents

Under the CPRA, compliance also applies to sharing as well as selling personal information. Cookies and other tracking technologies are classified as unique identifiers that form part of the CCPA’s definition of personal information.

If your business has a website, you must know and disclose to consumers, at or before the point of collection, the data you collect, via what cookies or other mechanisms, and which third parties you share it with. This can be done through the Cookiebot CMP cookie declaration that also features the required “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link, so end users can opt out of having their data sold or shared.

If your website is visited by consumers under the age of 16, or you collect sensitive personal information, you are required by the CCPA and CPRA to first obtain their opt in (or consent from a parent or guardian for children). This can be done through Cookiebot CMP’s CCPA opt-in banner.

Click [here](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/what-is-ccpa/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=banner) to find all the details about the CCPA and CPRA and how to achieve compliance.

### How do I make other plugins support Cookiebot™? ###

If your favorite plugin doesn’t support Cookiebot CMP you are always welcome to ask the developer to add support for it.

Send an email to the plugin developer you want to support Cookiebot™ and request that support for Cookiebot CMP be added. Cookiebot™ provides a helper function to check if there is an active, working version of Cookiebot CMP on the website.

The easiest way for a developer to implement Cookiebot CMP support is to add a check where tags are outputted to the visitor. This can be done following way:

$scriptTag = ‘‘;
if(function_exists(‘cookiebot_active’) && cookiebot_active()) {
$scriptTag = ‘<script’.cookiebot_assist(‘statistics’).’>’;
}

The developer of the plugin can see more details on our [Github repository](https://github.com/CybotAS/CookiebotWP).

### Can my website become compliant once I install Cookiebot CMP? ###
If you use our plugin version 3.0 or later and choose the automatic implementation, Cookiebot™ enables compliance with the prior consent requirement of the GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive (ePD) and similar privacy regulations for protection of user data around the world. Cookiebot CMP also enables compliance with the CCPA and CPRA through the implementation of the “Do Not Sell Or Share My Personal Information” link on a website’s cookie declaration, as well as the opt-in banner required if your website targets visitors under the age of 16 or processes sensitive personal information.

The default consent banner has the strictest settings possible and is suitable for obtaining consent under both the GDPR and the ePD. Make sure to adapt the consent banner design and content to fit your website. Check out our [GDPR checklist](https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000917513-Ready-for-25-May-2018-GDPR-enforcement-date-A-Cookiebot-checklist-) if you have website visitors from the EU. If you are using server-side cookies, please check the [Server-side usage guide](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/developer/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=banner).

Be aware that Cookiebot CMP is customizable, and therefore true compliance always depends on the settings that you make within the plugin and Cookiebot CMP Admin Interface.

**Are you using the manual implementation?** Please make sure to check if you are using plugins that set cookies that require consent. If so, you have to:
1. Ask the plugin developers if they are planning on becoming GDPR/CCPA compliant, or if they would like to integrate with Cookiebot CMP. Check out our [Github repository](https://github.com/CybotAS/CookiebotWP), where we are developing integrations for Cookiebot CMP, until the plugin developers choose to do this themselves, or if [WP Core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44043) enables such functionality.
2. Once Cookiebot CMP is installed, you can check the cookie report to identify all cookies being set on your website. If the cookies are coming from content that you have inserted manually, you can mark up that content [as described in step 4 in our manual implementation guide](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/manual-implementation/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=banner). Embedded videos and iframes which that set cookies can be marked up as explained in our [iframe cookie consent with YouTube example](https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003790854-Iframe-cookie-consent-with-YouTube-example).

Disclaimer: These statements do not constitute legal advice, but only serve to support and inform you about the Cookiebot CMP product. Please consult a qualified lawyer should you have any legal questions.

### Can I use Cookiebot™ with Google Tag Manager? ###
Cookiebot™ works with GTM. There are two different options for setting up GTM with Cookiebot CMP:

1. Use the Google Tag Manager option in the plugin settings to enable GTM with Cookiebot. Here you also have the option to enable Google Consent Mode for GTM.

2. Add the GTM script manually or by using another plugin for your site. Should you choose one of these methods, Cookiebot CMP must not be implemented using GTM as this would result in Cookiebot being loaded twice.

If you prefer the latter method, you should select **Hide Cookie Popup** in the Cookiebot CMP WordPress Plugin settings.

[Please see our article on how to deploy Cookiebot with GTM](https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003793854-Google-Tag-Manager-deployment).

### What is Google Consent Mode and can I use it with Cookiebot CMP? ###
Google Consent Mode is an open API that enables your website to run all Google services, such as Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, and Google Ads, based on the consent status of your end users. It helps you make the best use of visitors’ data and consent and automatically signals the consent status of your website users to all Google services.

Google Consent Mode is enabled by default in the Cookiebot CMP plugin.
[Learn more](https://support.cookiebot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016047000-Cookiebot-and-Google-Consent-Mode)

### What is the Digital Markets Act (DMA)? ###
The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is a regulatory framework introduced by the European Commission to regulate digital markets and address challenges to data privacy and the dominance of online tech giants. The law aims to ensure fair competition, enhance consumer protection, and promote innovation in the digital ecosystem. The DMA will have a significant impact on how large online platforms and the smaller third parties that use their services handle user consent and data. [Learn more](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/digital-markets-act-dma/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=banner).

### Who does the Digital Markets Act apply to? ###
The DMA applies to companies that operate large online platforms meeting specific criteria, such as having a significant impact on digital markets, acting as intermediaries between businesses and users, and enjoying a durable position of market power with significant influence over innovation. The DMA has designated these companies as “gatekeepers”. These platforms will be subject to enhanced regulatory obligations and scrutiny under the DMA. The DMA’s requirements protect online users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and the UK. The DMA does not apply outside of these areas, even though the currently designated gatekeeper companies are headquartered in the USA and China.

The six gatekeepers designated by the European Commission are:

- Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
- Alphabet (Google, YouTube, Android)
- ByteDance (TikTok)
- Apple (iOS, Safari)
- Amazon
- Microsoft (LinkedIn, Windows PC OS)

Although the DMA applies to these gatekeepers, smaller businesses should also be aware of and understand the law, as it’ll directly impact how they use the large online platforms and services owned by gatekeepers. Business owners will be responsible for following the compliance rules imposed by digital services such as those from Google and Amazon.

### Does Cookiebot™ integrate with WP Consent API? ###
Cookiebot™ is fully integrated with the WP Consent API. When your visitors give consent using Cookiebot CMP, the consent will automatically be sent to the [WP Consent API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-consent-api/).

You can define the mapping between Cookiebot™ and the WP Consent API in the administration interface (Cookiebot WP plugin).

### Does Cookiebot™ work with translation plugins? ###
Cookiebot CMP is compatible with translation plugins when you set language to **Use WordPress Language**.

### What are add-ons and can I use them with the Cookiebot CMP plugin? ###
Add-ons are tools produced by an open source community of developers. They enable you to implement opt-out for cookies and trackers set by plugins without built-in consent functionality. Add-ons signal the user's consent state to other plugins. You can use them with the Cookiebot CMP plugin.

Please note that we don't take responsibility for the use of add-ons, as we do not develop them and they are not under our control. There may be times when an add-on will not work properly until it has been updated to reflect changes in the plugin that the add-on hooks into.

If your favorite plugin isn't supported, feel free to request it via our [GitHub page](https://github.com/CybotAS/CookiebotWP).
